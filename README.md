Platypus wrapper for sPOD
===================================================
Wrapper for multi objective optimization of the hyperparameters of the JFB and ALM sPOD algorithms. URL: https://github.com/MOR-transport/sPOD/tree/sPOD-main

We minimize the relative reconstruction error, sum of the ranks of the frames Q^k and the L1 norm of the error matrix, if it is present, with the optimized parameters being lambda_s, lambda_E and mu/mu0. 

The optimized is performed via genetic algorithms taken directly from the Platypus module. URL: https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus

**BE AWARE THAT THIS CODE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE DEVS WILL INCREASE PERFORMANCE AND USABILITY**
